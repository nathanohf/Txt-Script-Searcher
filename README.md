# Txt-Script-Searcher

## About This Project
Quick project to get the file that a searched line exists in (mainly for the use in reading Memories Off 2nd script lol). Also because texthookers don't work for some reason atm.

## Usage
Drag the folder containing .txt files into root directory, and then edit line 38 in searcher.c to match that directory (subject to change)
i.e. ```char dir_path[] = "./memories-off-2nd-main"```
Run make, and run ./prog
